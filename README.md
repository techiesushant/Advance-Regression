# Business Objective:
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.

#### The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
- How well those variables describe the price of a house
- Based on the important driving factors the company wants to manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.

# Analytical Objective:
- Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
- Identify which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
- Understand how well those variables describe the price of a house.

Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
